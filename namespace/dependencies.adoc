# Dependencies Between Jakarta EE APIs

A major factor of incremental vs big bang is now small we could actually draw the circle.  If even one change cascades out greatly, all proposals are effectively big bang.

Raw data has been collected in JSON format so that we can all help in the analysis of any theoretical changes.

 - https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/blob/master/namespace/dependencies.json

## Issues with dependencies.json

This data should be considered a beginning.  There are two issues that need to be fixed for the data to be clean.

 - Split packages.  It was taken from the jars in Maven Central under the jakarta namespace.  The ejb-api.jar also contains non-ejb classes such as `javax.xml.rpc.handler.Handler`.  This taints results showing EJB as dependent on `javax.xml.namespace.QName`.

 - Java SE `javax` references still need to be filtered out.  In particular, `javax.management.ObjectName`, `javax.sql.DataSource` are Java SE and do not factor into any namespace discussions and therefore should be filtered out of the source data.

## Initial Reports

With the above caveats understood, some initial views:

 - https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/blob/master/namespace/transitive-dependencies.adoc

 - https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jakartaee-platform/blob/master/namespace/dependencies-classes-by-jar.adoc

## Needed Analysis Reports

 - Transitive view of each specs dependencies: if it is renamed, which specs are immediately and transitively affected.

 - Which specifications can be renamed without affecting other specificiations.

 - Given the most likely renames and factoring in transitive renames, how large is our most realistic "minimum" changeset.

 - What is the delta between big-bang and incremental given our most realistic "minimum" changeset.
