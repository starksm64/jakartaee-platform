== [[a3212]]Profiles

This chapter describes the requirements
common to all Java EE profiles. It does not define any concrete
profiles, delegating this task to separate specifications.

The Java EE Web Profile Specification,
published in conjunction with the present specification, defines the
first Java EE profile, the Web Profile.

The definition of other profiles is left to
future specifications.

=== Introduction

A Java EE profile (from now on, simply “a
profile”) represents a configuration of the platform suited to a
particular class of applications.

A profile may contain a proper subset of the
technologies contained in the platform. By doing so, a profile can
effectively drop technologies which the platform supports but which are
not generally useful in a particular domain.

A profile may also add one or more
technologies which are not present in the platform itself. For example,
a hypothetical Java EE Portal Profile would likely include the Portlet
API (JSR-286).

Additionally, a profile may tag certain
technologies as optional. In this case, products implementing the
profile may or may not include the technology in question. Naturally, if
they do, they need to obey all the relevant requirements mandated by the
profile specification.

A product may implement two or more Java EE
profiles, or the full platform and one or more Java EE profiles, as long
as their combined requirements do not give rise to conflicts.

=== Profile Definition

A profile is defined in accordance with the
rules of the Java Community Process. Typically, a proposal to create a
new profile, or to revise an existing one, will be submitted as a Java
Specification Request (JSR). Once the JSR is approved, an expert group
will be formed and conduct work as dictated by the process. The JSR for
a profile must mention the version of the Java EE Platform that it
builds on. Additionally, if it builds on an existing profile, it must
mention this fact as well.

Although profiles can be created and evolved
independently of the Java EE platform, modulo the rules contained in
this specification, it is envisioned that profiles will maintain a
reasonable level of alignment with the platform itself, in order to
avoid fragmenting the development space into progressively incompatible
islands. To this end, a profile must build on the most recent version of
the Java EE platform available at the time the JSR for the profile is
approved. It is also recommended that profile expert groups go beyond
this requirement and, as much as it is practical, ensure that their
profile builds on the most recent version of the Java EE platform at the
time the profile is finalized.

=== General Rules for Profiles

A profile must include all technologies that
are required components of the Java EE platform or of any profiles on
which it builds. These technologies will be listed as required in the
profile.

A profile may promote to required status any
technologies that are optional components of the Java EE platform or of
any profile on which it builds.

Unless otherwise mandated by a profile, any
technologies that are optional components of the Java EE platform, or of
any profile on which the profile in question builds, must be optional
components of the profile itself.

A profile may include as a required or as an
optional component any technology outside of those included in the Java
EE platform or any profile on which it builds, as long as the
corresponding compatibility requirements are satisfied.

A profile must preserve any requirements
defined in the Java EE platform specification, or in the specification
of any profile on which it builds, as long as the preconditions for
those requirements are satisfied. Typically, the preconditions will
involve the presence of one or more technologies among those included in
the profile. Unconditional requirements must be obeyed unconditionally.

A profile may add any requirements that
pertain to one or more technologies whose inclusion it allows or
requires. Such requirements must not conflict with those set by the Java
EE platform or by any profile on which the present one builds.

The specification for individual technologies
may allow for certain features of the technology in question to be
optional. In this case, a profile may promote one or more of these
features to required status, assuming the Java EE platform or any
profile on which it builds hasn’t done so already.

A profile must not conflict with the
specifications for any technologies it includes either as required or
optional components. Therefore, unless the specification for an
individual technology explicitly allows for certain features or sets of
requirements to be optionally implementable, a profile must not itself
attempt to redefine any such features or requirements. For example, a
profile may not allow omitting a package or type or method from an API
specified elsewhere, unless the specification for that API explicitly
allows for this to happen.

Although this specification does not define
any APIs, a profile may do so. Since such an API would be available only
in profiles that build on the one that defines it, this approach limits
the reusability of the API and thus is discouraged.

=== Expression of Requirements

The present specification uses the following
conventions when expressing requirements that pertain to one or more
technologies included in the platform:

* Chapters or sections which are conditional
on the presence of a specific technology are marked as such at the very
beginning. The condition is then intended to stay in force until the
next textual unit at the same logical level (e.g. the following chapter,
or section, etc.).
* Individual paragraphs and sentences are
deemed to be conditional on any technologies they mention, unless
otherwise indicated.
* Section or paragraphs which discuss
examples, or are otherwise non-normative, do not contain any
requirements.

=== [[a3240]]Requirements for All Java EE Profiles

The Java Platform, Standard Edition 8 is the
required foundation for any Java EE 8 profile.

The following technologies are required to be
present in all Java EE profiles:

* Resource and component lifecycle
annotations defined by the Common Annotations specification ( _Resource_
, _Resources_ , _PostConstruct_ , _PreDestroy_ )

The following functionality is required to be
supported in all Java EE profiles:

=== JNDI “java:” naming context (see link:#a607[See JNDI Naming Context]”)

* Java Transaction API (JTA)

=== Optional Features for Java EE Profiles

All the technologies listed in
link:#a2136[See Required APIs]”, and
not designated as required in
link:#a3240[See Requirements for All
Java EE Profiles]”, are designated as optional for use in Java EE
profiles.

The following functionality is designated as
optional for use in Java EE profiles:

* RMI/IIOP interoperability requirements (see
link:#a2875[See OMG Protocols (Proposed
Optional)]”)
* Support for _java:comp/ORB_ (see
link:#a1385[See ORB References]”)

=== [[a3252]]Full Jakarta™ EE Product Requirements

This section defines the requirements for
full Jakarta EE platform products. These requirements correspond to the
full set of requirements in previous versions of the Java EE platform
specification and update those requirements for this new version of the
platform.

Please note that, due to the effects of the
pruning process, future versions of the Jakarta EE specification will
likely relax the requirements given here, specifically by marking as
optional technologies that have been subject to pruning and that are
required by the present specification. The set of technologies that have
been made optional and/or identified as candidates for pruning is given
in link:#a2331[See Pruned Java
Technologies]”.

=== [[a3294]]Application Clients

This chapter describes application clients
in the Java™ Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE).

A full Java EE product must support the
application client container as described in this chapter. A Java EE
profile may or may not require support for the application client
container.

=== Overview

Application clients are first tier client
programs that execute in their own Java™ virtual machines. Application
clients follow the model for Java technology-based applications: they
are invoked at their _main_ method and run until the virtual machine is
terminated. However, like other Java EE application components,
application clients depend on a container to provide system services.
The application client container may be very light-weight compared to
other Java EE containers, providing only the security and deployment
services described below

=== Security

The Java EE authentication requirements for
application clients are the same as for other Java EE components, and
the same authentication techniques may be used as for other Java EE
application components.

No authentication is necessary when accessing
unprotected web resources. When accessing protected web resources, the
usual varieties of authentication may be used, namely HTTP Basic
authentication, SSL client authentication, or HTTP Login Form
authentication. Lazy authentication may be used.

Authentication is required when accessing
protected enterprise beans. The authentication mechanisms for enterprise
beans include those required in the EJB specification for enterprise
bean interoperability. Lazy authentication may be used.

An application client makes use of an
authentication service provided by the application client container for
authenticating its users. The container’s service may be integrated with
the native platform’s authentication system, so that a single signon
capability is employed. The container may authenticate the user when the
application is started, or it may use lazy authentication,
authenticating the user when a protected resource is accessed. This
specification does not describe the technique used to authenticate the
user, although a later version may do so.

If the container interacts with the user to
gather authentication data, the container must provide an appropriate
user interface. In addition, an application client may provide a class
that implements the _javax.security.auth.callback.CallbackHandler_
interface and specify the class name in its deployment descriptor (see
link:#a3399[See Java EE Application
Client XML Schema]” for details). The Deployer may override the callback
handler specified by the application and use the container’s default
authentication user interface instead.

If a callback handler is configured by the
Deployer, the application client container must instantiate an object of
this class and use it for all authentication interactions with the user.
The application’s callback handler must fully support _Callback_ objects
specified in the _javax.security.auth.callback_ package.

Note that when HTTP Login Form authentication is
used, the authentication user interface provided by the server (in the
form of an HTML page delivered in response to an HTTP request) must be
displayed by the application client.

Application clients typically execute in an
environment with a SecurityManager installed, and have similar security
permission requirements as servlets. The security permission
requirements are described fully in
link:#a2339[See Java Platform, Standard
Edition (Java SE) Requirements].”

=== Transactions

Application clients are not required to have
direct access to the transaction facilities of the Java EE platform. A
Java EE product is not required to provide a JTA _UserTransaction_
object for use by application clients. Application clients can invoke
enterprise beans that start transactions, and they can use the
transaction facilities of the JDBC API. If a JDBC API transaction is
open when an application client invokes an enterprise bean, the
transaction context is not required to be propagated to the EJB server.

=== Resources, Naming, and Injection

As with all Java EE components, application
clients use JNDI to look up enterprise beans, get access to resource
managers, reference configurable parameters set at deployment time, and
so on. Application clients use the _java:_ JNDI namespace to access
these items (see link:#a567[See
Resources, Naming, and Injection]” for details).

Injection is also supported for the
application client main class. Because the application client container
does not create instances of the application client main class, but
merely loads the class and invokes the static _main_ method, injection
into the application client class uses _static_ fields and methods,
unlike other Java EE components. Injection occurs before the _main_
method is called.

=== Application Programming Interfaces

Application clients have all the facilities of
the JavaTM Platform, Standard Edition (subject to security
restrictions), as well as various standard extensions, as described in
Chapter EE.6 “Application Programming Interface.” Each application
client executes in its own Java virtual machine. Application clients
start execution at the _main_ method of the class specified in the
_Main-Class_ attribute in the manifest file of the application client’s
JAR file (although note that application client container code will
typically execute before the application client itself, in order to
prepare the environment of the container, install a _SecurityManager_ ,
initialize the name service client library, and so on).

=== [[a3315]]Packaging and Deployment

Application clients are packaged in JAR format
files with a _.jar_ extension and may include a deployment descriptor
similar to other Java EE application components. The deployment
descriptor describes the enterprise beans, web services, and other types
of external resources referenced by the application. If the deployment
descriptor is not included, or is included but not marked
_metadata-complete_ , annotations on the main class of the application
client may also be used to describe the resources needed by the
application. As with other Java EE application components, access to
resources must be configured at deployment time, names assigned for
enterprise beans and resources, and so on.

The following table describes the cases the
deployment tool must consider when deciding whether or not to process
annotations on the application client main class. Whether or not to
process annotations depends on the presence and version of the
deployment descriptor and the setting of the _metadata-complete_
attribute.

The _metadata-complete_ attribute defines
whether the application client deployment descriptor is complete, or
whether the class files available to the application client module
should be examined for annotations that specify deployment information.
Deployment information, in this sense, refers to any information that
could have been specified by the application client deployment
descriptor for the module.

If the value of the _metadata-complete_
attribute is specified as _“true”_ , the deployment tool must ignore any
annotations that specify such deployment information in the class files
packaged in the application client jar file. Such annotations must also
be ignored when processing the class files that are available to the
application client module for the deployment of this module according to
link:#a3179[See Deploying a Java EE
Application]”.

Note that a _"true"_ value for the
_metadata-complete_ attribute does _not_ preempt the processing of _all_
annotations, only those that specify deployment information.

The list of annotations to which the
_metadata-complete_ attribute applies currently includes the following:



*  _javax.annotation.PostConstruct_
*  _javax.annotation.PreDestroy_
*  _javax.annotation.Resource_
*  _javax.annotation.Resources_
*
_javax.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition_
*
_javax.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinitions_

 __

*  _javax.ejb.EJB_
*  _javax.ejb.EJBs_

 __

*  _javax.jms.JMSConnectionFactoryDefinition_
*
_javax.jms.JMSConnectionFactoryDefinitions_
*  _javax.jms.JMSDestinationDefinition_
*  _javax.jms.JMSDestinationDefinitions_

 __

*  _javax.mail.MailSessionDefinition_
*  _javax.mail.MailSessionDefinitions_

 __

*  _javax.persistence.PersistenceUnit_
*  _javax.persistence.PersistenceUnits_

 __

*
_javax.resource.AdministeredObjectDefinition_
*
_javax.resource.AdministeredObjectDefinitions_
*
_javax.resource.ConnectionFactoryDefinition_
*
_javax.resource.ConnectionFactoryDefinitions_

 __

* All annotations in the following packages:
*  _javax.jws_
* javax.jws.soap
* javax.xml.ws
* javax.xml.ws.soap
* javax.xml.ws.spi

 __

If the _metadata-complete_ attribute is not
specified or its value is _"false"_ , the deployment tool must examine
the class files for all such annotations.

The tool used to deploy an application client
to the client machine, and the mechanism used to install the application
client, is not specified. Very sophisticated Java EE products may allow
the application client to be deployed on a Java EE server and
automatically made available to some set of (usually intranet) clients.
Other Java EE products may require the Java EE application bundle
containing the application client to be manually deployed and installed
on each client machine. And yet another approach would be for the
deployment tool on the Java EE server to produce an installation package
that could be used by each client to install the application client.
There are many possibilities here and this specification doesn’t
prescribe any one. It only defines the package format for the
application client and the things that must be possible during the
deployment process.

How an application client is invoked by an end
user is unspecified. Typically a Java EE Product Provider will provide
an application launcher that integrates with the application client
machine’s native operating system, but the level of such integration is
unspecified.

=== [[a3399]]Java EE Application Client XML Schema

The XML grammar for a Java EE application client
deployment descriptor is defined by the Java EE application-client
schema. The root element of the deployment descriptor for an application
client is _application-client_ . The content of the XML elements is in
general case sensitive. This means, for example, that
_<res-auth>Container</res-auth>_ must be used, rather than
_<res-auth>container</res-auth>_ .

All valid _application-client_ deployment
descriptors must conform to the XML Schema definition, or to a DTD or
schema definition from a previous version of this specification. (See
link:#a3447[See Previous Version
Deployment Descriptors].”) The deployment descriptor must be named
_META-INF/application-client.xml_ in the application client’s _.jar_
file. Note that this name is case-sensitive.


_link:#a3404[See Java EE Application
Client XML Schema Structure]_ shows the structure of the Java EE
application-client XML Schema. The Java EE application-client XML Schema
is located at
_http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/application-client_8.xsd_ .
