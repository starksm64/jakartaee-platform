== [[a3439]]Future Directions

This version of the Jakartaâ„¢ EE Platform specification includes most of the
facilities needed by enterprise applications. Still, there is always
more to be done. This chapter briefly describes our plans for future
versions of this specification. Please keep in mind that all of this is
subject to change. Your feedback is encouraged.

The following sections describe additional
facilities we would like to include in future versions of this
specification. Many of the APIs included in the Jakarta EE platform will
continue to evolve on their own and we will include the latest version
of each API.

=== Jakarta EE SPI

Many of the APIs that make up the Jakarta EE
platform include an SPI layer that allows service providers or other
system level components to be plugged in. This specification does not
describe the execution environment for all such service providers, nor
the packaging and deployment requirements for all service providers.
However, the Jakarta Connectors Specification does define the requirements
for certain types of service providers called resource adapters, and the
Jakarta Authorization specification defines requirements for
security service providers. Future versions of this specification will
more fully define the Jakarta EE SPI.
