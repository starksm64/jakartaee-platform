== Transaction Management

This chapter describes the required Java™
Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) transaction management and
runtime environment.

Product Providers must transparently support
transactions that involve multiple components and transactional
resources within a single Java EE product, as described in this chapter.
This requirement must be met regardless of whether the Java EE product
is implemented as a single process, multiple processes on the same
network node, or multiple processes on multiple network nodes.

If the following components are included in a
Java EE product, they are considered transactional resources and must
behave as specified here:

* JDBC connections
* JMS sessions
* Resource adapter connections for resource
adapters specifying the _XATransaction_ transaction level

=== Overview

A Java EE Product that includes both a servlet
container and an EJB container must support a transactional application
comprised of combinations of web application components accessing
multiple enterprise beans within a single transaction. If the Java EE
product also includes support for the Connectors specification, each
component may also acquire one or more connections to access one or more
transactional resource managers.

For example, in
_link:#a475[See Servlets/JSP Pages
Accessing Enterprise Beans]_ , the call tree starts from a servlet or
JSP page accessing multiple enterprise beans, which in turn may access
other enterprise beans. The components access resource managers via
connections.

=== [[a475]]Servlets/JSP Pages Accessing Enterprise Beans

image:Platform_Spec-8.png[image]

The Application Component Provider specifies,
using a combination of programmatic and declarative transaction
demarcation APIs, how the platform must manage transactions on behalf of
the application.

For example, the application may require that
all the components in _link:#a475[See
Servlets/JSP Pages Accessing Enterprise Beans]_ access resources as part
of a single transaction. The Platform Provider must provide the
transaction capabilities to support such a scenario.

This specification does not define how the
components and the resources are partitioned or distributed within a
single Java EE product. In order to achieve the transactional semantics
required by the application, the Java EE Product Provider is free to
execute the application components sharing a transaction in the same
Java virtual machine, or distribute them across multiple virtual
machines, in accordance with the requirements of the component
specifications.

The rest of this chapter describes the
transactional requirements for a Java EE product in more detail. +

=== Requirements

This section defines the transaction support
requirements of Java EE Products that must be supported by Product
Providers.

=== Web Components

Web components may demarcate transactions using
the _javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface or transactional
interceptors, which are defined in the JTA specification. They may
access multiple resource managers and invoke multiple enterprise beans
within a single transaction. The specified transaction context is
automatically propagated to the enterprise beans and transactional
resource managers. The result of the propagation may be subject to the
enterprise bean transaction attributes (for example, a bean may be
required to use Container Managed Transactions).

Web application event listeners and upgrade
handlers must not demarcate transactions using the
_javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface or transactional
interceptors. Servlet filters may use transactional resources within
their _doFilter_ methods but should not use any transactional resources
in the methods of any objects used to wrap the request or response
objects.

=== Transaction Requirements

The Java EE platform must meet the following
requirements:

* The Java EE platform must provide an object
implementing the _javax.transaction.UserTransaction_ interface to all
web components. The platform must publish the _UserTransaction_ object
in the Java™ Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) name space available
to web components under the name _java:comp/UserTransaction_ .
* The Java EE platform must provide classes
that implement the transactional interceptors, as defined by the JTA
specification.
* If a web component invokes an enterprise bean
from a thread associated with a JTA transaction, the Java EE platform
must propagate the transaction context with the enterprise bean
invocation. Whether the target enterprise bean will be invoked in this
transaction context or not is determined by the rules defined in the EJB
specification.

Note that this transaction propagation
requirement applies only to invocations of enterprise beans in the same
Java EE product instancelink:#a3649[2] as the invoking component.
Invocations of enterprise beans in another Java EE product instance (for
example, using the EJB interoperability protocol) need not propagate the
transaction context. See the EJB specification for details.

* If a web component accesses a transactional
resource manager from a thread associated with a JTA transaction, the
Java EE platform must ensure that the resource access is included as
part of the JTA transaction.
* If a web component creates a thread, the Java
EE platform must ensure that the newly created thread is not associated
with any JTA transaction.

=== [[a493]]Transaction Non-Requirements

The Product Provider is not required to support
the importing of a transaction context from a client to a web component.

The Product Provider is not required to support
transaction context propagation via an HTTP request across web
components. The HTTP protocol does not support such transaction context
propagation. When a web component associated with a transaction makes an
HTTP request to another web component, the transaction context is not
propagated to the target servlet or page.

However, when a web component is invoked
through the _RequestDispatcher_ interface, any active transaction
context must be propagated to the called servlet or JSP page.

=== Transactions in Web Component Life Cycles

Transactions may not span web requests from a
client on the network. If a web component starts a transaction in the
_service_ or _doFilter_ method (or transactional interceptor of
_service_ or _doFilter_ method), it must be completed before the
_service_ or _doFilter_ method returns to the network
clientlink:#a3650[3]. Returning from the _service_ or _doFilter_
method to the network client with an active transaction context is an
error. The web container is required to detect this error and abort the
transaction.

As specified above in
link:#a493[See Transaction
Non-Requirements],” requests made within a web container using the
_RequestDispatcher_ must propagate any transaction context to the called
class. Unless the called class commits or aborts the transaction, the
transaction must remain active when the called class returns.

If a servlet that is called via the
_RequestDispatcher_ starts a transaction, the behavior of the container
with regard to that transaction is unspecified when the servlet returns
from its service method. The web container may throw an exception to the
caller, abort the transaction and return to the caller without error, or
propagate the transaction context back to the caller. Portable servlets
will complete any transaction they start before returning from the
service method.

=== Transactions and Threads

There are many subtle and complex interactions
between the use of transactional resources and threads. To ensure
correct operation, web components should obey the following guidelines,
and the web container must support at least these usages.

* JTA transactions should be started and
completed in the thread in which the _service_ method is called.
Additional threads that are created for any purpose should not attempt
to start JTA transactions.
* Transactional resources may be acquired and
released by a thread other than the _service_ method thread, but should
not be shared between threads.
* Transactional resource objects (for example,
JDBC _Connection_ objects) should not be stored in static fields. Such
objects can only be associated with one transaction at a time. Storing
them in static fields would make it easy to erroneously share them
between threads in different transactions.
* Web components implementing
_SingleThreadModel_ may store top-level transactional resource objects
in class instance fields. A top-level object is one acquired directly
from a container managed connection factory object (for example, a JDBC
_Connection_ acquired from a JDBC _ConnectionFactory_ ), as opposed to
other objects acquired from these top-level objects (for example, a JDBC
_Statement_ acquired from a JDBC _Connection_ ). The web container
ensures that requests to a _SingleThreadModel_ servlet are serialized
and thus only one thread and one transaction will be able to use the
object at a time, and that the top-level object will be enlisted in any
new transaction started by the component.
* In web components not implementing
_SingleThreadModel_ , transactional resource objects, as well as Java
Persistence _EntityManager_ objects, should not be stored in class
instance fields, and should be acquired and released within the same
invocation of the _service_ method.
* Web components that are called by other web
components (using the _forward_ or _include_ methods) should not store
transactional resource objects in class instance fields.
* Enterprise beans may be invoked from any
thread used by a web component. Transaction context propagation
requirements are described above and in the EJB specification.

=== Enterprise JavaBeans™ Components

The Java EE Product Provider must provide
support for transactions as defined in the EJB specification.

=== Application Clients

The Java EE Product Provider is not required to
provide transaction management support for application clients.

=== Applet Clients

The Java EE Product Provider is not required to
provide transaction management support for applets.

=== [[a516]]Transactional JDBC™ Technology Support

A Java EE product must support a JDBC
technology database as a transactional resource manager. The platform
must enable transactional JDBC API access from web components and
enterprise beans.

It must be possible to access the JDBC
technology database from multiple application components within a single
transaction. For example, a servlet may wish to start a transaction,
access a database, invoke an enterprise bean that accesses the same
database as part of the same transaction, and, finally, commit the
transaction.

A Java EE product must provide a transaction
manager that is capable of coordinating two-phase commit operations
across multiple XA-capable JDBC databases. If a JDBC driver supports the
Java Transaction API’s XA interfaces (in the _javax.transaction.xa_
package), then the Java EE product must be capable of using the XA
interfaces provided by the JDBC driver to accomplish two-phase commit
operations. The Java EE product may discover the XA capabilities of JDBC
drivers through product-specific means, although normally such JDBC
drivers would be delivered as resource adapters using the Connector API.

=== [[a520]]Transactional JMS Support

A Java EE product must support a JMS provider
as a transactional resource manager. The platform must enable
transactional JMS access from servlets, JSP pages, and enterprise beans.

It must be possible to access the JMS provider
from multiple application components within a single transaction. For
example, a servlet may wish to start a transaction, send a JMS message,
invoke an enterprise bean that also sends a JMS message as part of the
same transaction, and, finally, commit the transaction.

=== Transactional Resource Adapter (Connector) Support

A Java EE product must support resource
adapters that use _XATransaction_ mode as transactional resource
managers. The platform must enable transactional access to the resource
adapter from servlets, JSP pages, and enterprise beans.

It must be possible to access the resource
adapter from multiple application components within a single
transaction. For example, a servlet may wish to start a transaction,
access the resource adapter, invoke an enterprise bean that also
accesses the resource adapter as part of the same transaction, and,
finally, commit the transaction.

=== Transaction Interoperability

=== Multiple Java EE Platform Interoperability

This specification does not require the Product
Provider to implement any particular protocol for transaction
interoperability across multiple Java EE products. Java EE compatibility
requires neither interoperability among identical Java EE products from
the same Product Provider, nor among heterogeneous Java EE products from
multiple Product Providers.

We recommend that Java EE Product Providers use
the IIOP transaction propagation protocol defined by OMG and described
in the OTS specification (and implemented by the Java Transaction
Service), for transaction interoperability when using the EJB
interoperability protocol based on RMI-IIOP.

=== Support for Transactional Resource Managers

This specification requires all Java EE
products to support the _javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface, as
specified in the Connector specification. This specification also
requires all Java EE products to support the
_javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface for performing two-phase
commit operations on JDBC drivers that support the JTA XA APIs. This
specification does not require that JDBC drivers or JMS providers use
the _javax.transaction.xa.XAResource_ interface, although they may use
this interface and in all cases they must meet the transactional
resource manager requirements described in this chapter. In particular,
it must be possible to combine operations on one or more JDBC databases,
one or more JMS sessions, one or more enterprise beans, and multiple
resource adapters supporting the _XATransaction_ mode in a single JTA
transaction.

=== Local Transaction Optimization

=== Requirements

If a transaction uses a single resource
manager, performance may be improved by using a resource manager
specific local optimization. A local transaction is typically more
efficient than a global transaction and provides better performance.
Local optimization is not available for transactions that are imported
from a different container.

Containers may choose to provide local
transaction optimization, but are not required to do so. Local
transaction optimization must be transparent to a Java EE application.

The following section describes a possible
mechanism for local transaction optimization by containers.

=== A Possible Design

This section illustrates how the previously
described requirements might be implemented.

When the first connection to a resource manager
is established as part of the transaction, a resource manager specific
local transaction is started on the connection. Any subsequent
connection acquired as part of the transaction that can share the local
transaction on the first connection is allowed to share the local
transaction.

A global transaction is started lazily under
the following conditions:

* When a subsequent connection cannot share the
resource manager local transaction on the first connection, or if it
uses a different resource manager.
* When a transaction is exported to a different
container.

After the lazy start of a global transaction,
any subsequent connection acquired may either share the local
transaction on the first connection, or be part of the global
transaction, depending on the resource manager it accesses.

When a transaction completion (commit or
rollback) is attempted, there are two possibilities:

* If only a single resource manager had been
accessed as part of the transaction, the transaction is completed using
the resource manager specific local transaction mechanism.
* If a global transaction had been started, the
transaction is completed treating the resource manager local transaction
as a last resource in the global 2-phase commit protocol, that is using
the last resource 2-phase commit optimization.

=== Connection Sharing

When multiple connections acquired by a Java EE
application use the same resource manager, containers may choose to
provide connection sharing within the same transaction scope. Sharing
connections typically results in efficient usage of resources and better
performance. Containers are required to provide connection sharing in
certain situations; see the Connector specification for details.

Connections to resource managers acquired by
Java EE applications are considered potentially shared or shareable. A
Java EE application component that intends to use a connection in an
unshareable way must provide deployment information to that effect, to
prevent the connection from being shared by the container. Examples of
when this may be needed include situations with changed security
attributes, isolation levels, character settings, and localization
configuration. Containers must not attempt to share connections that are
marked unshareable. If a connection is not marked unshareable, it must
be transparent to the application whether the connection is actually
shared or not.

Java EE application components may use the
optional _shareable_ element of the _Resource_ annotation or the
optional deployment descriptor element _res-sharing-scope_ to indicate
whether a connection to a resource manager is shareable or unshareable.
Containers must assume connections to be shareable if no deployment hint
is provided. link:#a3399[See Java EE
Application Client XML Schema]”, the EJB specification, and the Servlet
specification provide descriptions of the deployment descriptor element.

Java EE application components may cache
connection objects and reuse them across multiple transactions.
Containers that provide connection sharing must transparently switch
such cached connection objects (at dispatch time) to point to an
appropriate shared connection with the correct transaction scope. Refer
to the Connector specification for a detailed description of connection
sharing.

=== JDBC and JMS Deployment Issues

The JDBC transaction requirements in
link:#a516[See Transactional JDBC™
Technology Support]” and the JMS transaction requirements in
link:#a520[See Transactional JMS
Support]” may impose some restrictions on a Deployer’s configuration of
an application’s JDBC and JMS resources. Java EE Product Providers may
impose the restrictions described in this section to meet these
requirements.

If the deployer configures a non-XA-capable
JDBC resource manager in a transaction, then a Java EE Product Provider
may restrict all JDBC access within that transaction to that
non-XA-capable JDBC resource manager. Otherwise, a Java EE Product
Provider must support use of multiple XA-capable JDBC resource managers
within a transaction. In addition, a Java EE Product Provider may
restrict the security configuration of all JDBC connections within a
transaction to a single user identity. A Java EE Product Provider is not
required to support transactions where more than one JDBC identity is
used. Specifically, this means that transactions that require the use of
more than one JDBC security identity (which can be done explicitly via
component provided user name and password) may not be portable.

A Java EE Product Provider may make the same
restrictions as above, resulting in a transaction being restricted to a
single JMS resource manager and user identity.

In addition, when both a JDBC resource manager
and a JMS resource manager are used in the same transaction, a Java EE
Product Provider may restrict both to a pairing that allows their
combination to deliver the full transactional semantics required by the
application, and may restrict the security identity of both to a single
identity. To fully support such usage, portable applications that wish
to include JDBC and JMS access in a single global transaction must not
mark the corresponding transactional resources as “unshareable”.

Although these restrictions are allowed, it is
recommended that Java EE Product Providers support JDBC and JMS resource
managers that provide full two-phase commit functionality and, as a
result, do not impose these restrictions.

=== Two-Phase Commit Support

A Java EE product must support the use of
multiple XA-capable resource adapters in a single transaction. To
support such a scenario, full two-phase commit support is required. A
JMS provider may be provided as an XA-capable resource adapter. In such
a case, it must be possible to include JMS operations in the same global
transaction as other resource adapters. While JDBC drivers are not
required to be XA-capable, a JDBC driver may be delivered as an
XA-capable resource adapter. In such a case, it must be possible to
include JDBC operations in the same global transaction as other
XA-capable resource adapters. See also
link:#a516[See Transactional JDBC™
Technology Support].”

=== System Administration Tools

Although there are no compatibility
requirements for system administration capabilities, the Java EE Product
Provider will typically include tools that allow the System
Administrator to perform the following tasks:

* Integrate transactional resource managers
with the platform.
* Configure the transaction management parts of
the platform.
* Monitor transactions at runtime.
* Receive notifications of abnormal transaction
processing conditions (such as abnormally high number of transaction
rollbacks).
